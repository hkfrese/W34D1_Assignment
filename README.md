# üé• Video Streaming Platform - Systems Design

A comprehensive systems design solution for a scalable video streaming platform that supports video uploads, streaming, subscriptions, and real-time notifications.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This platform follows a microservices architecture with the following key layers:

- **Client Layer**: Web, mobile, and smart TV applications
- **API Gateway**: Load balancing, authentication, and CDN
- **Microservices**: Independent services for core functionality
- **Data Layer**: Multiple databases optimized for different use cases

## üîß Core Services

### User Service
- User registration, authentication, and profile management
- JWT-based authentication with session management
- User preferences and channel management

### Video Service
- Video upload with chunked/resumable transfers
- Metadata management and video processing pipeline
- Multi-quality streaming with adaptive bitrate

### Notification Service
- Real-time WebSocket notifications
- Push notifications for mobile devices
- Subscription-based content alerts

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Architecture

### PostgreSQL (Primary Database)
- **Users**: Account information and authentication
- **Videos**: Metadata, upload status, and basic metrics
- **Subscriptions**: Channel subscriptions and preferences

### MongoDB (Analytics & Content)
- Video analytics and engagement metrics
- Comments and user-generated content
- Real-time interaction data

### Redis (Caching)
- Session management and authentication tokens
- Frequently accessed video metadata
- Real-time notification queues

### Amazon S3 (Storage)
- Raw video file storage
- Processed video files (multiple qualities)
- Thumbnails and user-generated images

## üìä Key Features

- **Scalable Video Processing**: Asynchronous processing with multiple quality outputs
- **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket and push notification support
- **Global CDN Distribution**: Fast video delivery worldwide
- **Advanced Search**: Elasticsearch-powered video discovery
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive viewer and engagement metrics

## üöÄ Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling
- Auto Scaling Groups for each microservice
- Load balancing with health checks
- Database read replicas for high-traffic scenarios

### Performance Optimization
- Multi-layer caching strategy (Redis, CDN, Application)
- Database partitioning for large datasets
- Asynchronous processing with message queues

### Bottleneck Solutions
- **Video Upload**: Chunked uploads with S3 presigned URLs
- **Database Load**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Search Performance**: Elasticsearch clustering with optimized indexing

## üîÑ Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for real-time operations
- **Asynchronous**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live features

## üìà Traffic Handling

The system is designed to handle:
- **10M+ concurrent users**
- **1M+ video uploads per day**
- **100M+ video views per day**
- **Real-time notifications** to millions of subscribers

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Python microservices
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 with CloudFront CDN
- **Infrastructure**: AWS with Auto Scaling and Load Balancing
- **Real-time**: WebSocket, Server-Sent Events

## üìã API Highlights

### Video Upload
```http
POST /api/videos/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

### Get Video Stream
```http
GET /api/videos/{videoId}
Response: Multiple quality streaming URLs
```

### Subscribe to Channel
```http
POST /api/subscriptions/{channelId}
Response: Subscription confirmation with notification preferences
```

## üîê Security Features

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Video content moderation pipeline
- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- HTTPS everywhere with SSL termination

## üì± Client Support

- **Web Application**: React-based responsive interface
- **Mobile Apps**: Native iOS/Android applications
- **Smart TV Apps**: Platform-specific applications
- **API Access**: RESTful APIs for third-party integrations
